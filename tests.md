### Feature: Telegram bot token stored in dedicated global file

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- A valid Telegram bot token is available.
- Access to `~/.codex/` on the host machine.

#### Steps
1. In the app UI, open Telegram connection and submit a bot token.
2. Verify file `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` exists.
3. Open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm it contains a `botToken` field.
4. If `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json` exists, confirm `telegram-bridge` key is absent after configure.
5. Restart the app server and call Telegram status endpoint from UI to confirm it still reports configured.

#### Expected Results
- Telegram token is persisted in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
- Telegram bridge remains configured after restart.
- Legacy `telegram-bridge` key is not re-written into `~/.codex/.codex-global-state.json`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear saved Telegram token.
